Work-in-Progress: A personal blog that will contain personal cooking recipes.

For simplicity reason, the initial version of this blog, the recipes will be categorised into two big categories: main, side dish. The blog will provide a pool of recipes with steps and ingredients, which later the data can be re-used when we are building other features in the future, such as meal planner, grocery list, etc.
